# Labelmaker

Make printable QR code labels for samples using basic information about a project (later: information provided in a spreadsheet).

## Installation

First create a conda environment called `labels` where you will install the package [`qrcode`](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/).

```
conda create -n labels pandas python=3
source activate labels
pip install qrcode[pil]
```

Clone the Labelmaker repository to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/cuttlefishh/labelmaker
```

## Execution

Run the Jupyter notebook. This will be replaced by a Python script in the near future.
